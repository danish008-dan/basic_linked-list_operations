Singly Linked List - Python
===========================

Overview
--------
A Singly Linked List is a linear data structure where each element
(points to the next element in the sequence.

Each node contains:
- Data
- Reference to the next node

Operations
----------
- Insert at beginning
- Insert at end
- Delete a node
- Search an element
- Traverse the list

Time Complexity
---------------
Insertion at beginning: O(1)
Insertion at end:       O(n)
Deletion:               O(n)
Search:                 O(n)

Space Complexity
----------------
O(n)

Advantages
----------
- Dynamic size
- Efficient insertion and deletion
- No memory wastage as in arrays

Disadvantages
-------------
- No random access
- Extra memory required for pointers

Use Cases
---------
- Dynamic memory management
- Implementation of stacks and queues
- Music playlist and navigation systems
